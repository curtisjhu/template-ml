# Template for Computer Vision Models
Here are the ML models for Computer Vision I've built. They are very generic ones. Nothing ground-breaking or "cutting-edge."

To read more indepth, look into the `readme.md` files within each folder. 
Some of them will have short "tutorials" or mathematical derivations if they are easy enough to explain.

Dataset | Type | Batches | Epochs | Device | Accuracy  |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
MNIST | PyTorch | 32 | 5 | cpu | 98.98 %
MNIST | TF | 32 | 5 | cpu | 97.99%
